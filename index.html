        <h2>The Things I'm Interested In</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been interested in a wide variety of topics. My favorite as a kid was by far geography and geopolitics. 
            I can still today name every member of the UN (and those that should be memebers, but aren't). However, my interest in how nations interact with 
            one another and led me down a road of how different peoples generally interact with one another, and finally to how individuals interact on an 
            interpersonal basis, and the ethics surrounding any interaction. In other words, I became more interested in philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also always been fascinated by fiction and the creative mind in general. It can be used to simply escape our world and enter a reality where 
            fantastical things can happen. More importantly, however, fiction can serve a speculative purpose for our future, whether that be an interpersonal 
            conflict that we could ponder our own potential actions in, or our future politically. For example, it can be useful to speculate on a future like the one in 
            Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, and wonder what we may may do in a world where women are subjugated, and if there is any way we could prevent it before it could happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also interested in in video games. I specifically like games like Minecraft, Final Fantasy, Skyrim, Zelda, Mario, Smash Bros, et cetera. 
            I try to take in variety of different genres and styles of games. There was a game I played once called A Short Hike, and that game always
            stuck with me because of its style and simplicity. I'll even play games like Dark Souls, even though I'm not all that great at them. But even 
            if I can't beat games like that, I still like to give myself a nice challenge, rather than always taking the easy path.
