Hello! Welcome to my website. I plan to share some of the things that I find interesting,
and the things I do to keep my mind fresh.

I love to program, hike, play video games, and learn languages (human and computer).

## Experience
I have a degree in Computer Science from Utah Valley University. I agraduated with a 3.54 cumulative GPA.

I still continuously strive to improve my skills, challenge myself, and learn new concepts. I proudly do not 
use AI in any of my code or writings whatsoever.
