Hello! Welcome to my website. I plan to share some of the things that I find interesting,
and the things I do to keep my mind fresh.

I love to program, hike, play video games, and learn languages (human and computer).

## Experience
I have always loved computers and technology my entire life. Some of my earliest memories are figuring out how to 
burn CDs on iTunes, and trying to figure out how to run Wine on Mac (so that I could play Wizard 101).

I was able to build my first computer around 12 years old
with some spare and cheap parts that my dad got me. I loved that computer. In a way, I still have a ship of permethius type
situation with the current computer I have. My main station is still an evolution of that one, slowly over time (although I doubt
there are any shraed parts with it anymore).

My love for computers eventually led me to try out an introductory programming course at my university to see if I would
be interested in Computer Science. Turns out I had a solid intuition for it! I smashed that course out of the park with a 98% in the end.
The class was in Python, and introduced all of the basics about programming.

I then took the followed up with the sequel - Object-Oriented Programming: The Only Valid Way to Think About A Problemâ„¢. It was good!
The class was tought in C++, and because of that, I learned a bunch about low-level design in the process. I remember pointers being such a 
hard idea to process. Oh sweet child, just wait! I did super well in that class as well. I managed to finish with about a 95%.

I then took a year off of school for personal reasons. But when I returned in 2020, I returned with passion. I was ready to slay the final boss
before being able to delcare Computer Science my major. I was ready to tackle Data Structures & Algorithms, the most notroious class of them all.
Honestly, this one was probably the easiest of them all. It was taught in Python again, so nothing low-level to think about. I already knew
a bunch of programming basics, how classes worked, and low-level things like pointers. The hardest concept for me to grapple in this class was
definately recursion. But even that wasn't too bad. I finished this class with about 98%.

And with that class finished, I was finally accpted into the College of Engineering and Technology and Utah Valley University!

I continued my studies with more generalized classes like Database Theory, Operating System Theory, Web I & II, UI/UX, etc. And while I did well
in those classes, I found that I excelled in the more fundamental/low-level classes. Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Archeture, Dectrete Math I & II, 
AI, etc. I got A's in all of those classes.

When I returned to school in 2020, my GPA was 3.0. This was because I was mostly working on my general classes. But when I was able to specialize,
I managed to increase my GPA to about 3.6. All purely through excelling in CS classes.

## Regrets

I graduated at probably the worst time imaginable for a CS grad. In fall 2023, hundreds of thousands of software developers were being layed off,
and very few job openings were being posted to compensate. The result? Hundreds of thousands of developers with more experience and (crucially)
connections were flooding the few open jobs available. 

How was I, a recent graduate with no work experience and few connections supposed to compete? Good question. I still don't know. After applying
to hundreds of jobs, I mostly got rejections, if anything at all.

But I'm not here to throw a pity party for myself. Instead, I just want to honestly look at my personal regrets in college.

First of all, I think it's important to note that I was homeschooled growing up. While I didn't mind the experience, the result was that 
I was never taught how to go to college. It was honestly extremely overwhelming to go from such a stark difference fromt he laid-back
homeschooling approach to a rigid college routine. I also never really had the oppurtunity to talk to anyone, ever, about their college
experience. Their regrets, their successes, what is crucial to focus on, etc.

Maybe if I had had that oppurtunity, I would have known to to prioritize relationships in college. I never really got to know many people,
simply becuase I was extremely socially awkward, anxious, and was not equipped for social situations. 

I also would have pursued internships. I knew about internships, and I had trhis vague notion that they were valuable. But I was never
encouraged by anyone in my life to pursue them. So I honestly had no idea just how important they are. Because I never did any internships,
I now have no experience beyiond my college experience. I suppose that might not be that bad of a thing for many careers. But becoming a 
software developer in the 2020's is extremely competitive. Not having much more in the way of 'experience' to demonstrate to the HR 
representives who have no clue what a compiler is can be your downfall. HR people don't know how to code. They don't know what a compiler
is, or how hard projects can be,
but they know what Adobe is, and a summer intership there sounds pretty nice.
